## How to use it ?

There are 3 ways to use this NPM module. Here they are:

### From locally...

First of all, create an empty folder whatever your location in the file 
system of your computer:
```bash
mkdir test
```
__Clarification:__ the empty folder created is named ```test``` and will 
be the case for the rest of the demonstration, however you can name it 
whatever you like.

Now, go to the newly created directory:
```bash
cd test
```
You have to clone the ```time_calculous_for_npm``` git repos on GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vicken-Ghoubiguian/time_calculous_for_npm
```
Now it's time to create your JavaScript file and open it to then use the 
module ```time_calculous_for_npm```. To do so, create a file named 
```index.js``` and open it:
```bash
touch index.js

nano index.js
```
__Clarification__: the empty file created is named index.js and will be 
the case for the rest of the demonstration, however you can name it 
whatever you like.

In the newly created file ```index.js```, it is now time to import the 
module ```time_calculous_for_npm```. To do this, copy then paste the 
following line into the file ```index.js```:
```js
var time_calculous_for_npm = require('./time_calculous_for_npm');
```
Now it's your turn to have fun. So...Get ready, get set and code.
